Encrypt your thoughts and store them on cloud storage sites without compromising your privacy!

Ever wrote some epic bad ass ideas for a game, movie, novel or web comic? 
Does it suck when the computer you wrote it on gets thrown out the window?
Too anxious to upload them to a cloud storage site because "they own your IP"?

Just yesterday as of uploading this I answered yes to all these questions.
So I lazily cobbled together this python script.
I named her Suho (수호)
Suho will encrypt the very plain text on your .txt files with a password.
And Suho can decrypt the encrypted text .txt files with that very same password.

Feel free to download for yourself.
Here's to flipping off that AI pervert on google cloud!
