# Suho (수호)
Encrypt your thoughts and store them on cloud storage sites without compromising your privacy!

Ever wrote some epic bad ass ideas for a game, movie, novel or web comic?
<br/>
Does it suck when the computer you wrote it on gets thrown out the window?
<br/>
Too anxious to upload them to a cloud storage site because "they own your IP"?

Suho will encrypt the very plain text on your .txt files with a password, and Suho can decrypt the encrypted text .txt files with that very same password.

Feel free to download for yourself.
